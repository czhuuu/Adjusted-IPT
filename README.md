<strong>Adjusted Intraperiod Timeliness (Adjusted IPT):</strong> a measure of speed of price discovery that penalizes for inefficient overreaction.

The simpler Adjusted IPT file contains a SAS macro to calculate the simpler Adjusted IPT measure, as implemented in "<strong><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11142-017-9422-2">Capital Market Effects of Media Synthesis and Dissemination: Evidence from Robo-Journalism</a></strong>," assumes that the daily return accumulation is immediately at open, while the more complex Adjusted IPT measure assumes even return accumulation over a given day. The Adjusted IPT file contains a SAS macro to calculate IPT (without the adjustment) and (the more complex) Adjusted IPT. For more details on the two different assumptions, please see the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2966859">Internet Appendix</a>.
